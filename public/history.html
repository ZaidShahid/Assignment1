					<h1 id="about">The Zaid Shahid School Overview</h1>
					<p>
					<br />
					Established in Karachi in 1978, The City School is today one of the largest private school networks in Pakistan with branches in all the major cities across the country. It currently has 185 schools in 52 cities with over 126,000 students in 458 owned and franchised schools. The City School continues to expand its reach to meet the demands for quality education. The knowledge and skills-based curriculum derived from the UK national curriculum guides students from Nursery to Cambridge International Examinations (for the 16 and 18 year age group), qualifying them for the IGCSE, and O and A Level examinations. The uniform implementation of the curriculum gives parents, students, and teachers the advantage of a smooth and efficient transfer from one school to another within the system.
					</p>
					<br />
					<br />
					
					<h1 id="vision">Curriculum & Academic Philosophy</h1>
					<p>
					<br />
					Graduates from The City School secure positions in top universities worldwide. Our students, according to Cambridge International Examinations annual results analysis, are amongst the highest achievers in their city, their country and, in some cases, in the world. The curriculum encourages a student-centred approach where learners have an active role in their learning process and develop the skills and ability to make a significant contribution to society. Its particular strength lies in the integration of digital media and ICTs in an array of learning programmes. The City School provides more than 120 courses each year across the age ranges and revises them in accordance with the cumulative experience of its teachers and pupils. The selection of teachers is based on their experience as curriculum developers and syllabus writers. In addition, we regularly appoint curriculum consultants from the UK to lead teams of The City School teachers in revising their curriculum and syllabi. The City School curriculum and methodology is designed specifically to ensure a smooth transition in teaching and learning from the primary sector through the middle years and on to the final two years of the public examinationsâ€™ syllabi. Digital media and ICTs in The City School Network are shaping the methodology of delivering online education and adding efficiency, convenience, interactivity and outreach to the array of learning programmes we offer. The City School has taken the initiative of implementing a state-of-the-art Classroom/ Learning Management System capable of providing its students with academic resources anytime, anywhere, and in any circumstances. The City School promotes and encourages co-curricular activities in all of its campuses. Students are encouraged to learn new skills, take responsibility, assume leadership, work under a leader, organise events, conduct programmes and experience real-life situations.
