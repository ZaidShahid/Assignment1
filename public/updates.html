					<br />
					There are really no words to describe the experience I have of this school. The children are genuinely loved here by the teachers. They help us to build confidence in ourselves which is the most special element of SVA. Studying here is a great opportunity

					This school has been an amazing place for me as I have noticed in the past 8 years of my education here that SVA gives each and every student the right to put forward his views and ideas.It gave me foundation to strengthen myself physically and mentally and gave me the understanding to see the world in a different way. This school is truely a magical place and I cannot give a higher recommendation.

					<br />
					Apart from building up our foundation, sva has taught us right from wrong, and has also built up our confidence to identify our strengths and weaknesses and guided us well to optimize our capacities.I have been studying here since my entire life and sva has made me understand the importance of education.
What I have understood about education is that the foundation years are the most important years and are the bricks which give strength to a strong future.

					<br />
					SVA is like a second home for children, as SVA gives such detailed attention to every single student that it is inevitable for student to not find SVA as a school but their home where they can be themselves and bring out the best of them.
