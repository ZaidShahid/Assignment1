					<h1 id="about">About School</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
					<br />
					The title The City School suggests one school â€“ which, in fact, it is, though its network stretches across Pakistan. That a child may join The City School in Kashmir, Punjab, Baluchistan, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, or in Sindh, as part of a system that encourages regional pride yet instils a uniform set of values acceptable nationwide and internationally, has an important nation building and unifying purpose behind it.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
					The Zaid Shahid School offers its students a comprehensive selection of Advanced Level subjects in three disciplines; Science, Social Science and Business. 
					</p>
					
					<br />
					<br />
					
					<h1 id="vision">Our Vision</h1>
					<hr />
					<p>
					<br />
					The Zaid Shahid School embraces value-based learning through the core principles of respect, integrity, compassion and accountability. It aims to provide each student a diverse and holistic education in a safe, supportive and nurturing environment that promotes self-discipline, motivation, and excellence in learning 
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
					Our highly competitive academic environment challenges students to do their best as scholars while providing extra-curricular avenues for them to pursue other talents, passions and interests.  We envision our students as future civic leaders and seek to inculcate in them practices that go beyond the mere following of rules and regulations and the observance of punctuality. Rather, we simultaneously endeavor to ensure that students consider the school environment as a microcosm of the larger community we live in and hence comport themselves with courtesy and kindness towards everyone along with an imbibed sense of humility and sensitivity towards social and cultural differences.   
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
					The fostering of these values among Zaid Shahid School students allows them to take independent initiatives and leadership roles once they graduate. Overall their training enables them to move forward on the path to become responsible adults who make meaningful contributions to society in an increasingly interdependent global community.  
					</p>
					
					<br />
					<p>
					At Zaid Shahid School we treat young people as individuals who will eventually play their role in society. Our philosophy incorporates the belief that education is primarily a preparation for life. We encourage parents and students to understand and embrace our mission prior to seeking admission to The Zaid Shahid School.
